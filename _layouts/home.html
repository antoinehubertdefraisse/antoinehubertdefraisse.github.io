              <b>Crowding Out Long-Term Corporate Investment: The Role of Long-Term Government Debt Supply</b></a></p>

    <p align="justify"> <u><em>Abstract:</em></u> 
Using large, plausibly exogenous shocks to the maturity structure of U.S. government debt, I provide causal evidence that the supply of long-term government debt affects the duration of corporate investment. 
I find that an increase in the supply of long-term government debt  causes a crowding out of long-duration investment, via an increase in long-term discount rates. 
This crowding out manifests through reallocations of capital away from long-duration investment towards short-duration investment. 
Such reallocations occur across industries,  within industries across firms and within firms across divisions. 
Due to the prevalence of asset-liability maturity matching, the resulting variations in the aggregate duration of investment significantly contribute to fluctuations in aggregate corporate debt maturity.
My findings imply that policies which influence the net supply of long-term bonds, such as public debt management and central bank quantitative easing or tightening, affect the composition of corporate investment.

      </a></p> 
	  <p>with Adrien d'Avernas (Stockholm School of Economics), Liming Ning (UChicago Booth), and Quentin Vandeweyer (UChicago Booth)</p>
        <p>
              <p align="justify"> <u><em>Abstract:</em></u> 
This work proposes a framework to study the risk-benefit trade-off of quantitative easing (QE) for the consolidated government, integrating the central bank and treasury department. In a simple model with distortionary taxes, nominal frictions, and a zero lower bound, we characterize the optimal size of a QE program as equalizing the marginal benefit from stimulating output to the marginal cost of induced rollover risk for taxpayers. A conservative quantification of this trade-off suggests that QE programs in the US made a positive net present contribution to welfare.

      </a></p>  
            </a></p> 
	  <p>with Pierre Dubuis (Bank of England)</p>
        <p>
 <p align="justify"> <u><em>Abstract:</em></u> 
We present evidence that loan spreads earned by banks  over marketable interest rates are, in the French business lending context, inversely related to the level of short-term interest rates. 
Controlling for the pricing of credit and interest rate risks, we show that this negative correlation is consistent with a credit supply shock: banks who increase loan spreads more when interest rates decline also experience lower growth in credit supply.
We find empirical support for theories that link frictions in the deposit-taking business to lending outcomes of financially constrained banks. 
Lower rates compress deposit spreads earned by banks, prompting constrained banks to reduce lending, and explaining the rise in loan spreads. 
We also find support for a complementary channel, lending market power. 
Specifically, lenders with higher market share and borrowers facing a higher "hold-up problem" are associated with a lower interest rate pass-through. 
Finally, we provide novel evidence of negative real effects on corporate financing and investment for firms borrowing from banks with lower interest rate pass-through.</p>
